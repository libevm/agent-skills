# Agent Skills

Tailored workflow.

## AI Agent

Use [pi](https://pi.dev/)

Its a surgical knife, precision at the expense of convenience.

Manual compact.


```bash
npm install -g @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent
```

## Skills

You will need node.js for the majority of additional features.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.4/install.sh | bash
nvm install --lts
```

"std" pi-skills (web browsing etc).

```bash
# User level
git clone https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills ~/.pi/agent/skills/pi-skills

# Or project-level
git clone https://github.com/badlogic/pi-skills .pi/skills/pi-skills
